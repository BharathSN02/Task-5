Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Passenger analysis
 Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Summary of Findings:
1.	Ticket Class is a major factor in survival:
Passengers in 1st Class had the highest survival rates.
2.	Fare is positively linked to survival:
Higher fare-paying passengers had a significantly better chance of survival.
3.	Family Size Impact:
Small family groups had slightly better survival rates compared to passengers traveling alone or with large families.
4.	Port of Embarkation:
Most passengers boarded from Southampton. Additional analysis could check whether survival rates varied by embarkation port.
5.	SibSp and Parch Correlation:
Passengers traveling with family (siblings/spouses or parents/children) had some association, but family size alone did not guarantee survival.
6.	Visual Correlation Insights:
Strongest drivers of survival: Passenger Class and Fare.
Family size and embarkation port have weaker but still noteworthy relationships.
